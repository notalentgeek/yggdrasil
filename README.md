# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is a note (and later file management) web application.

## Vision

* Create a note management tool that makes:
    * Note easily searchable
    * Note so portable and can be carried everywhere
    * Note with rich media

## To-Do List:

* **(DONE)** Look for Go project directory structure 
* **(DONE)** Look for basic .gitignore for Go project
* **(DONE)** Create basic Hello World program in Go
* Create or find a function that behave like Python's `walk()`
    * **(DONE)** Check walk function example from Go standard library
    * **(DONE)** Rewrite the walk function to understand it better (perhaps, adjust it based on my needs)
    * Create the function in the main project.
        * **(DONE)** Create some empty functions

## Appendixes

## Appendix 1: Resources

* Go Project Folder Structure: [https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
* Common Go Project .gitignore: [https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Go.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Go.gitignore)
* Go `walk()` Function from Standard Library Documentation and Example: [https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk)

## Appendix 2: Go Project Directory Structure 

* /internal directory is used to hold all of your Go files that are not reusable with your other Go projects.
* /tools directory is used to hold all tools related files. Any third-party files that help you on developing this project, for example: Visual Studio Code Workspace file.
